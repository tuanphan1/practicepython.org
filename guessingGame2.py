#  This time, weâ€™re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number
# between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too 
# high, too low, or your number.

# At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
