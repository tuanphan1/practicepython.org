# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors 
# of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another 
# number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Please enter a number "))

x = range(1, number)

for num in x:
    if (number % num) == 0:
        print(str(num) + " is a divisor of " + str(number))
