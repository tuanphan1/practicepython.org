# The next logical step is to deal with handling user input. When a player (say player 1, who is X) 
# wants to place an X on the screen, they canâ€™t just click on a terminal. So we are going to 
# approximate this clicking simply by asking the user for a coordinate of where they want to place
# their piece.


# As a reminder, our tic tac toe game is really a list of lists. The game starts out with an empty 
# game board like this:

game = [[0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]]

    playerInput.strip()

        game[moveList[0]][moveList[1]] = player
